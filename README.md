PLIB is suppose to be a very simple and easy to use library in C that offers good ergonomics,
and high level functions and data-structures, This project is my take on what the libft should
be, I don't like Libft. I think that functions from the std, should be avoided or at least wrapped
when performance is not a concern, as they are all very much terrible. PLIB try to solve this problem
by trying to be consistent as much as possible.

PLIB is still WIP.
